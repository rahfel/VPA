# Background
This repository contains analysis code for the article:Integrative genomics reveals pathogenic mediator of valproate-induced neurodevelopmental disability.

We applied bulk-tissue RNA-sequencing to brain samples derived from 30 pups, including healthy VPA treated and untreated pups; and epileptic VPA treated and untreated pups.

Code used to process and analyse bulk-tissue RNA-sequencing data and to generate plots can be found in the folder titled "Codes"
