# Background
This repository contains analysis code for the article:Chronic gestational valproate is associated with transcriptional changes in the brain functionally and genetically related to neurodevelopmental disease.
We applied bulk-tissue RNA-sequencing to brain samples derived from 30 pups, including healthy VPA treated and untreated pups; and epileptic VPA treated and untreated pups.

Code used to process and analyse bulk-tissue RNA-sequencing data and to generate plots can be found in the folder titled "Codes"
